# AnonIn

I almost never want someone to know I visited their LinkedIn profile. But I also
want to know when someone visits my LinkedIn profile. As such I usually keep my
LinkedIn profile viewing options on public. When I want to view someone's
profile, I change my profile viewing options to private. When I'm done, I change
them back to public (if I remember). This is quite laborious.

AnonIn is a Firefox/Chrome extension that automatically changes LinkedIn
visibility to private before visiting a person's profile, changing it back to
previous settings when navigating away.

NOTE TO SELF: considering prompting user to change settings back after period of
time; upon tab close seems very difficult and some users may keep tab
permanently open.
